# Overview

In this program I provided a print statement displaying "Hello World!" and a little introduction about myself.

I created this software to test my coding environment and set up, as well as to introduce myself as a programmer.

# Development Environment

I used the IDE Visual Studio Code to write my code as well as GitHub to keep my work organized on a public platform.

I used Python to build my program, which I love using because of it's clean and simple syntax style.
